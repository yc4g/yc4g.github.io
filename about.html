						<p>Founded by Emon Datta, Yale Code4Good is an official student-run organization that connects students from the Computer Science and the Statistics and Data Science departments at Yale University with local nonprofits that can benefit from their technological skills. In addition, we host events such as talks and summits that show the Yale community how to use technology can be used for social good. All members of the Yale community are welcome! </p>

							<h3>Recruitment</h3>
							<p>We usually recruit new members for our board and tech teams in the Spring semester. To ensure that new members will be committed, we follow an online application by an interview to get to know each person better.</p>
							<p>New opportunities sometimes come up in both the Spring and Fall semester, so make sure to subscribe to our panlist to find new ways of getting involved! </p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<div class="feature-text">
							<h3>Board</h3>
							<p>The board oversees all the recruitment process, events' organization, communication and reaching out with partner nonprofits, and all internal communications. The board consists of people who want to change the technological culture at Yale from one of technology for the sake of technology, to one where students reflect about and apply their skills to solve our most pressing social issues. Most members of the board have STEM backgrounds, but we always welcome non-STEM students who have great ideas to push forth our mission!</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<div class="feature-text">
							<h3>Tech Teams</h3>
							<p>The tech teams are groups of students who work on projects for our partner nonprofits or organizations. They are independent, self-driven students who are willing to put on the necessary time and effort to learn the necessities of the nonprofit, and apply and learn the respective technologies to address them. Each tech team has a tech lead who is in charge of overseeing the project, communicate any updates to the nonprofit/organization, and report back to the board anything that is needed.    </p>
